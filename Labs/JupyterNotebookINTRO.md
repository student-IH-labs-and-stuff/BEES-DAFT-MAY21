## Introduction
Creating a Jupyter notebook that is well commented and tells the story of your code / project is very important. 

It will be relevant for your upcoming projects during the bootcamp.

## Objective 
We are giving you a deliberately silly exercise to get comfortable with jupyter notebook, and how to submit work from jupyter to us via github and the student portal. 

## Getting Started
Open a new jupyter notebook file on your laptop. 

In the notebook that you created, you will introduce someone and her/his holidays preference with a picture and a link to a youtube video of this holiday preference 
(It can be you, a friend or family member :D) 

+ Give the notebook a heading title 
+ Explain the purpose of the notebook with a markdown cell
+ Write a function that takes an input - which will be the selected person's name
+ upload a photo of that person to the notebook 
+ Write a function that takes input for their holidays preference. This can be one question or multiple questions to understand this person's preferences. Make sure you test it yourself. 
+ Add a photo or screenshot of the holiday destination
+ Add bullet points of the top 3 things that the person likes to do  at this destination.
+ Try to make the text colorful, bold or italic.
+ Add a link to a youtube video of the destination.
+ add relevant annotations to explain any function or module you have used 

### Bonus 
+ create an navigable index at the top of your jupyter notebook  
+ Add titles to all sections you have created, and then create hyperlinks from the elements of the index to their corresponding section title.


## Deliverables
notebook (.ipynb file) with your responses named as Jupyterlab.ipynb


## Submission
clone your repo github locally 
Upon completion of the noteboook, save your deliverables to your github repo clone (local folder)
Then add, commit git (using an appropriate commit message) and push your local copy changes to the remote
submit your github url via your student portal to let us know you have completed the lab
