## Project Description
The objective of this project is choosing a topic that interests you, find related data, completing an end-to-end analysis and presenting your findings. Understand what research has already been done in that area and perhaps identify question(s) that are still unanswered. Then, look for data that you think could help you answer those questions and analyze it, using python EDA methods you have learnt and visualizations to support your reasoning. You could apply any technique you have learnt during the course so far. Finally, we are expecting yout to present your result in a short presentation and a technical paper.

This project can be individual but also can be done in group mode - 2 to 4 students could work together on the same topic, or collaborate by sharing ideas, methods and resources. Lets us know who is in your group on Friday afternoon so we can arrange you into your mentor groups. 

This project allows you to use **data from any ironhackers past projects**


--------------

## Project Goals
During this project you will:
* Research and analyze data related to a topic of your interest.
* Apply the statistical techniques you have learned (if needed).
* Create useful and easily understandable plots.
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately and engagingly.
* Learn to adapt your communication style to your audience.
* Present within a time limit 
* Complete an End to End data analysis project

## Data Workflow
In this project you will focus on Data Analysis, Data Wrangling and Visualization skills.

## Requirements & Deliverables
The **mandatory** requirements that this project needs to satisfy are:
* The project must be planned. That is why creating a Kanban board is important. You can find a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/3KyyUMZa/collab-project). Remember that you **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
* Your repository must be clean and organized; this means that it must include a README file and also have a functional file structure that is easy to navigated
* The project needs to be presented to your colleagues on friday Jul 2nd.

The **mandatory** deliverables that you must submit are:
* Link to the repository you used while working on your project. The repository must include all the files you used to complete your analysis. Remember to commit often to avoid trouble in case you make mistakes: this means more than 1 commit!
* Link to Trello or picture of your Kanban Board. Include the link or picture in the README file.
* A short technical paper illustrating your analysis in whatever format you prefer (e.g. Medium article, Jupyter Notebook, Technical Report, readme, pdf etc.)

## Mentoring
One of the TAs or LT will be your mentor!

Your mentor will:
* Keep track of your project day by day to ensure you are able to manage in the week.
* Your mentor will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
* Check if you are following your plan: are you keeping up with your tasks and deadlines? Do you have any obstacles blocking you?
* Help/support you with specific questions.

Your mentor is **not** meant to:
* Know everything.
* Be your manager. You have to be responsible for your own tasks!

## Schedule

**Please note** that the following schedule is simply a guideline. Feel free to organize your work as you see fit.

**Friday**
* Choose a topic for your project.
* Find interesting questions related to your topic.
* Brainstorm to find out what kind of data you can use to answer those questions.
* Research and look for the data you need.

**Monday**
* **CHECKPOINT:** brief your mentor on the project topic you have chosen
* Create the project repository and edit the README as an overview. Remember to keep the README up-to-date.
* Plan your project. Remember that we are providing you with a Trello [template](https://trello.com/b/3KyyUMZa/collab-project). You **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
* Retrieve the data
* Clean your data.
* Start working on your analysis and plots.

**Tuesday**
* **CHECKPOINT:** General follow-up and resolution of eventual doubts/blockers.
* Continue work on your analysis and plots.
* Prepare a draft of the non-analysis slides of your presentation: title, motivation, context, etc.

**Wednesday**
* Complete the analysis and slides.
* First draft of the technical report/article.

**Thursday**
* Final technical report/article.
* Presentations rehersal time **from 16:00** in breakout rooms with your mentor!
* final improvements!

**Friday**
* Presentations time **at 09:30**!

## Presentation  
Projects will be presented to another IH class! Presentations will be **EXACTLY** 5 minutes long, with 2 additional minutes for questions. We will stop you at 5 minutes so make sure to rehearse your presentation to avoid exceeding the time limit!  
The audience will evaluate the presentation by indicating how well they understood what you were trying to explain and how you presented it. This information will help you in further presentations!

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize your work (don't get lost!).
* Remember that Google has the answers to most of your questions. Should you not be able to find the answer on your own the TAs are here to help you.
* Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you.
* Learn about your subject and understand what other research has been done about the topic.
* Think about what kind of concept or information you want to convey before using a visualization.
